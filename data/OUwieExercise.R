#Here is a basic exercise for OUwie, along with more advanced topics

require('OUwie')

?OUwie #gives help on OUwie

data(tworegime) #a sample dataset included with OUwie. It's made up data but runs well for examples

ls() #what does that dataset have in it?

print(tree) #prints a summary of the tree object

#Notice it has node labels. This is how regimes are mapped onto the tree. 

print(trait) #prints what the trait object is.

#But is it a matrix, a list, a data.frame, what? Two ways to look at this:
class(trait) #just tells what the class is
dput(trait) #prints the internal structure of the object. Can be handy with debugging








#Plot the tree and the internal nodes to highlight the selective regimes:
select.reg<-character(length(tree$node.label)) 
select.reg[tree$node.label == 1] <- "black"
select.reg[tree$node.label == 2] <- "red"
plot(tree) 
nodelabels(pch=21, bg=select.reg)








#Now to run it!
#This takes longer than you may be used to. 
#We're a bit obsessive about doing multiple starts and in general
#performing a thorough numerical search. It took you 3+ years
#to get the data, may as well take an extra five minutes to 
#get an accurate answer

#Let's try a few other models, too
#The models are "BM1","BMS","OU1","OUM","OUMV","OUMA","OUMVA" (and you've already done "OUMV")

#Start with BM1 and OU1 (YOU figure out how to do this). What do these models mean? What are their results?

#This is an easier way to write what you were doing. A faster way to analyze it would be to use mclapply rather than lapply (see the parallels package)

#The below only works if the discrete trait rate is low, so you have a good chance of estimating where the state is.
#If it evolves quickly, hard to estimate where the regimes are, so some in regime 1 are incorrectly mapped in
#regime 2 vice versa. This makes the models more similar than they should be.
#See Revell 2013, DOI:10.1093/sysbio/sys084 for an exploration of this effect.
